# ghigliottina-LLM
A python notebook to train a LLM to play “La Ghigliottina”, the final game of an Italian TV show called “L’Eredità”. The game involves a single player who is given a set of five words unrelated to each other, but related with a sixth word that represents the solution to the game.

I took inspiration from the challenge organized for EVALITA 2020 (https://www.ai-lc.it/ghigliottin-ai-a-evalita-2020/)
